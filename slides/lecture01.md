## ES6

### What is ES6?

- ES6 is the most recent spec of what constitutes the JavaScript language. It is, at this point, mostly adopted on the Node side.
- ES6 provides a series of very large conveniences, especially with easier asynchronous code handling

## Asynchronous Code Is Messy

- In general, writing asynchronous code is syntactically messy.
  - Ends up in deeply nested callbacks
  - Creates huge promise chains
  - Hard to error check  
    As a result, over the last several years, the JavaScript language has added a concept of `async functions and await`ing the end of an asynchronous operation.
